/// | `false`                 | `true`                | **High refresh** — refresh rate → bit depth → color format (descending) |
/// | `true`                  | `true`                | **Color fidelity** — same as color-fidelity mode; fidelity takes precedence |
/// | `false`                 | `false`               | **Power saving** — all three criteria reversed (ascending), minimising bandwidth |
